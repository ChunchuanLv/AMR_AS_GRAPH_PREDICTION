stars
A star
lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; If she does n't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame - ups
two kinds of smart female stars . Those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations
the second kind
the trick
their objectives achieved with their seed money
even some super female stars

this way
some alcohol
the advertiser or show sponsor
the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder
her chin or kiss

Those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this

Here 's another prodiction :

This September
home
University . I was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until I got here ! Now I 'm here
over two weeks
the majority of my life
Secondary School
my dad
the age of 9
that for my feelings
two periods of counselling in my life , over roughly 15 months from December 2009 until around March this year
the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self - esteem . I have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions
anything and everything
Neither of my counsellers
depression
a huge worry to me
depression
the cause of my dad 's death , suicide
my problems
exercise and meditation particularly useful
things like self - help books and tapes .
my general feeling , is , '
this what my life will be ? My one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man
these feelings
things
Friends
a lot of the time
everything anyone
people
time and time
anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and I feel a bit like a self - seeking moaner , but I truly do feel desperate
people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles
a university student
a health professional
personal experience which is why I strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression
Most people
an appointment with your uni
services
anyone
some problems at the minute
some support
labels are n't as important as your experiences
Meditation and exercise
help and life
anything
the minute
lots of people
better . Being unkind to yourself
some help
a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends .
a ' solution ' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . Either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to PM
focus
an idol
Someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc
Focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why .... is it because you wanted the experience ? Because your mum wanted yo to go ?
a degree for the career
Either way
sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt
hard work and i passed
X
hope this helps
